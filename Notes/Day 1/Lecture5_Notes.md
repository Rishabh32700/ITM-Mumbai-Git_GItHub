   ```
3. Verify by listing the folderâ€™s contents.

### **3. Profile README Customization**

## **Interview Questions and Answers**

1. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - Git is a version control system that helps manage source code history, while GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform for Git repositories.  
     - Git is used locally on your machine, while GitHub allows for collaboration, hosting, and sharing code with others.

2. **What is a fork in GitHub, and why is it used?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - A fork is a copy of a repository that resides in your GitHub account. It is used to make changes to someone else's project without affecting the original repository. You can later contribute back via a pull request.

3. **What are the differences between a `git merge` and a `git rebase`?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - `git merge` combines changes from two branches and preserves the history of both branches.  
     - `git rebase` applies changes from one branch on top of another, rewriting the commit history to make it linear.

4. **How can you revert a specific commit in Git?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - You can use the `git revert <commit-hash>` command. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced in the specified commit.

5. **What is the purpose of a .gitignore file?**  
   - **Answer:**  
     - The `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This is commonly used for files like logs, build artifacts, or sensitive configuration files.
