## Part 3: Complex Practical Activity (30 Minutes)

- **Objective:** To demonstrate the ability to manage a software project using Git and GitHub, including handling branches, merge conflicts, and pull requests.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Fork an existing repository from a given GitHub account.
  2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
  3. Create a new branch named `development` and switch to it.
  4. Add a new feature or modify existing code and commit the changes.
  5. Push the changes to your forked repository.
  6. Create another branch named `feature-x`, make additional changes, and commit.
  7. Intentionally create a conflict between `development` and `feature-x`.
  8. Merge `feature-x` into `development` and resolve the conflict.
  9. Push the resolved changes.
  10. Create a pull request from `development` to the original repositoryâ€™s `main` branch.
